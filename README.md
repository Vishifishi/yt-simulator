Sign in to upload videos using the camera icon. You can only upload when signed in, but videos can be watched whether signed in or out.

Welcome to the Youtube simulator. This application is designed to handle video uploads, processing, and storage at scale, leveraging Google Cloud's powerful suite of services. With seamless user authentication, efficient video handling, and an intuitive web client, this platform provides everything needed to manage video content with ease.

Features
Scalable Video Storage
Videos are stored securely using Google Cloud Storage, ensuring scalability and reliability. Raw video files are uploaded to a private bucket, while processed videos are stored in a public bucket for easy access.

Efficient Video Processing
Uploaded videos are processed asynchronously using Cloud Run. Workers automatically scale based on demand, ensuring smooth operations even during high upload traffic. Videos are transcoded using ffmpeg, an industry-standard tool for video processing.

Metadata Management
Processed video metadata, such as titles, descriptions, and processing statuses, is stored in Firestore, enabling seamless retrieval and display. This ensures users have instant access to information about their videos.

Integrated Web Client
The platform features a modern Next.js web client hosted on Cloud Run. Users can sign in, upload videos, and browse their content with a clean, intuitive interface.

Robust Authentication
Authentication is handled by Firebase Auth, enabling users to securely sign in with their Google accounts. Each userâ€™s profile is stored in Firestore, allowing for personalized experiences.

Workflow
User Sign-Up and Authentication
Users sign up and log in using their Google accounts. Upon registration, a Firestore document is automatically created for each user, storing their profile details.

Video Upload
Authenticated users upload videos via a signed URL generated by a Firebase Function. This ensures that only authorized users can upload content. The raw videos are stored in a secure Cloud Storage bucket.

Asynchronous Video Processing
A Cloud Pub/Sub message is triggered upon video upload, queuing the event for processing. Workers on Cloud Run retrieve these messages, transcode the videos using ffmpeg, and upload the processed videos back to Cloud Storage.

Metadata Storage and Retrieval
Once processing is complete, the video's metadata is saved in Firestore. This data is used by the web client to display video details and statuses.

Web Interface
The web client allows users to manage their videos effortlessly. They can upload new files, view processed videos, and access relevant metadata.
